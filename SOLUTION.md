#### If this project continued, anything else you would like to add?

I believe this project will serve the main purpose.

#### Anything else of note you'd like the interviewers to know about?

The home url contains params (org_name) this was done to make the homepage route dynamic.<br/>
Also, the user can use the url params to validate they are viewing the correct organization, <br/>
if a user modify the route params and the org_name is not valid, it redirect to the default organization (Qatalog).<br/>
